# **Differences of var, let, and const.**


### var: 
#### var variables are declared with the var keyword. They are block-scoped, which means that they are accessible from the block in which they are declared and from any nested blocks. var variables are also hoisted, which means that they are created at the top of their scope, even if they are declared later.

### let:
#### let variables are declared with the let keyword. They are also block-scoped, but they are not hoisted.

### const:
#### const variables are declared with the const keyword. They are block-scoped and immutable, which means that their value cannot be changed after they are declared.
